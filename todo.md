Here's the prioritized implementation checklist for your Farcaster Quiz Frame v2:

**Foundation Setup**
- [x] Initialize Next.js TypeScript project with `/quiz` route (Next.js)
- [ ] Configure NEYNAR_API_KEY in .env.local (Environment)
- [x] Create QuizState type with questions, score, currentIndex (Types)
- [x] Define CastResponse type with cast text and metadata (Types)
- [ ] Add mobile viewport meta tag in _document.tsx (CSS)

**Core Systems**
- [ ] Implement /api/casts/[fid] route with error handling (API)
- [ ] Create Zustand store with persistence middleware (State)
- [ ] Build processCasts utility with question generation (Logic)
- [ ] Setup CanvasWrapper with resize handler (UI)

**Data Flow**
- [ ] Connect API route to QuizContainer data fetching (Integration)
- [ ] Add localStorage sync for user progress (State)
- [ ] Implement cast-to-question transformation (Logic)

**UI Components**
- [ ] Create QuizContainer with loading spinner (Layout)
- [ ] Build QuestionCard with animated options (UI)
- [ ] Develop ScoreSummary with retry button (UI)
- [ ] Add WalletIntegration component shell (UI)

**Interactions**
- [ ] Implement handleAnswer with score update (Logic)
- [ ] Add touch event handlers with feedback (UX)
- [ ] Create animation hook with WebGL fallback (UX)

**Optimization**
- [ ] Add cache-control headers to API responses (Performance)
- [ ] Implement requestAnimationFrame in canvas (Performance)
- [ ] Setup error boundaries for critical components (Reliability)

**Final Polish**
- [ ] Connect all state to UI components (Integration)
- [ ] Implement mobile-first grid layout (CSS)
- [ ] Add production build configuration (Deployment)
- [ ] Verify Farcaster Frame compliance (Testing)

**Post-Launch**
- [ ] Create shareable result snippet (Social)
- [ ] Implement points calculation display (UX)
- [ ] Add orientation change handler (Responsive)

Each task builds on previous completion. Start with foundation setup, move through core systems, then assemble UI components with interactions. Save optimizations and polish for after core functionality is verified.
